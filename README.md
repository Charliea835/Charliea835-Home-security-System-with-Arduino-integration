# Charliea835-Home-security-System-with-Arduino-integration

This project was completed as a team based project for my third year in college. This project utilises an arduino board and includes features like: taking images of intruders, recording data about how far people came to your door and displays all this data on a website. The applcation allows users to log in and see this data and search for the nearest stations to alert the authorities.
